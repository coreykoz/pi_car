# pi_car

A raspberry pi powered RC car. Future plans:

## First Goal

1. Control both DC motors (acceleration and steering) through software using RPi GPIO pins alongside an Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor Bonnet.
2. Have the RPi host a local web server for future camera and controls.
2. Have the ability to control the car through the client's web browser.
3. Create live webcam feed, contained on same page as controls, to drive car in first person view.
4. Implement controller support for clients (or server, might be easier/lower latency)

## Second Goal
Using the camera, implement various image recognition and machine learning techniques to attempt basic car autonomy.
